# Bid Beasts – Security Findings (Low Severity)

This repository contains my documented findings from the **First Flight #49** contest.

Although these findings are low severity, they demonstrate my growing skill in:
- Identifying logic inconsistencies  
- Reading complex contract flows  
- Maintaining clear, structured reporting  
- Focusing on practical impact and expected behavior  

I’m actively participating in more audits and contests and am continuously improving in:
- Fuzz testing (Foundry, Echidna basics)  
- Web3 security research  
- Vulnerability triage  
- Tooling (Slither, Aderyn, Foundry invariants & fuzzing)  

## ✨ Findings Included
| ID | Title |
|----|-------|
| L-01 | First bid cannot equal minimum price |
| L-02 | Auction deadline mismatch between docs and implementation |

You can find the full writeups in the `findings/` folder.
